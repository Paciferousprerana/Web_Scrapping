# Web Scrapping
This README.md file provides an overview and instructions for a web scraping project that utilizes the Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries. The project aims to extract data from websites and store it in a structured format using the Pandas library.

# Project Overview
The web scraping project focuses on extracting top 20 repositories each of top 30 topics from https://github.com/topics webpage. Beautiful Soup is a Python library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages, while Pandas provides powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities. By combining these two libraries, we can scrape data from websites and store it in a tabular format for further analysis.

## Dependencies
To run this web scraping project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

* Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org).

* Beautiful Soup: Install the Beautiful Soup library using the following command: pip install beautifulsoup4

* Pandas: Install the Pandas library using the following command: pip install pandas

## Project Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the project repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open the ipynb notebook in jupyter or google colab.

3. Run the notebook. (It includes all the installation required).

## Usage
1. Open the ipynb file.

2. Identify the target website from which you want to extract data. Modify the script to according to the web page you wish to scrape. (or you can use the github webpage as done in this file.)

3. Review the structure of the web page you intend to scrape and identify the HTML elements that contain the data you want to extract. Update the script to specify the appropriate HTML tags, classes, or IDs to locate the desired data.

4. Customize the code to parse the HTML structure of the web page using Beautiful Soup. Extract the relevant data using Beautiful Soup's methods and functions.

5. If necessary, clean or preprocess the extracted data to remove any unwanted characters or format it according to your needs.

6. Use the Pandas library to create a data structure, such as a DataFrame, to store the extracted data in a structured format.

7. Perform any additional data analysis or manipulation using the Pandas library as required.

8. You can also save the extracted data to a file, such as a CSV or Excel file, using Pandas' built-in functionality. (This part is not included in this file)

## Troubleshooting
* If the web page structure or layout changes, you may need to update the script to adjust the HTML tags, classes, or IDs used to locate the desired data.
* Some websites may have terms of service or usage policies that prohibit web scraping. Make sure to review the website's terms and conditions and respect any applicable restrictions or guidelines.
